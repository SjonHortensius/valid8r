# valid8r

An open-source command line interface for linting your Ethereum 2.0 validator set up, maintained by Pondron LLC.

## Overview

valid8r is a tool to ensure Ethereum 2.0 validator set-up integrity to give peace of mind to the implementer and more importantly ensure the network runs smoothly. valid8r will act as a linting tool of sorts to read out to the implementer what system settings are correct, what systems settings need to be changed, and what system settings do not follow best practices.

## Updates to `master` branch

Main development of new features should be directed towards the upstream
git repos. The `master` branch of this repo will periodically pull in new
changes from upstream to provide a point for integration.
